# Union Audits

This repository contains security audit reports for Union. Union uses zero-knowledge cryptography and recursive consensus and state proofs to verify all transfers and packets. There are no multisigs or trusted parties involved and the protocol is fully permissionless. ZKPs can be permissionlessly generated by anyone with 5GB ram and do not require big proving markets or server farms. It locks and unlocks assets and data based on merkle-inclusion proofs based on state roots provided by Light Clients. Solvers are able to fill orders before light clients are updated for faster-than-finality transfers.


The audits are conducted by various security firms to ensure the protocol's safety and reliability.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/audits`: Contains all audit reports in PDF format
